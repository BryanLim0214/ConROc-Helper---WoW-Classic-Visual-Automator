## üíæ Installation & Setup

This application is provided as a standalone executable (`.exe`) for Windows.

1.  Download the latest `.exe` file from the **[Releases](link/to/your/releases)** section of this repository.
2.  Place the `.exe` file in a folder of your choice on your computer.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Launch the Application:** Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file.
2.  **Configure Detection Area:** üéØ
    * Go to the **Detection Settings** tab.
    * Click the **Select Area** button. Your screen will dim slightly.
    * Click and drag a rectangle around the specific area on your screen where your rotation helper addon (like ConROc) displays the **icon of the *next* recommended spell**. Make the selection reasonably tight around the icon area.
    * The X, Y, Width, and Height fields will update automatically.
    * (Optional) Click **Preview Area** to see a pop-up window showing a snapshot of the selected region.
3.  **Add Your Spells:** ‚ú®
    * Go to the **Spells** tab (visible in the screenshot).
    * Click **Add New**.
    * **Spell Name:** Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Fireball", "Heroic Strike").
    * **Keybinding:** ‚å®Ô∏è Enter the exact keybind assigned to this spell on your WoW action bar (e.g., `1`, `f1`, `ctrl+5`, `shift+r`). Format: modifiers (`ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`) followed by `+`, then the key (use lowercase letters).
    * **Image Path:** üñºÔ∏è You need an image of the spell icon *as it appears in the detection area*.
        * **Option A (Recommended): Capture:**
            1.  Click the **Capture** button.
            2.  Your screen will dim again. Click and drag a *tight* box around the spell's icon *within the game or rotation addon's display area*.
            3.  A "Save As" dialog will appear. Save the captured image (e.g., `fireball_icon.png`) somewhere on your computer. The path will be filled automatically.
        * **Option B: Browse:** Click **Browse...** and select an existing image file of the spell icon from your computer. Ensure the image is clear, well-cropped, and matches how it looks in the detection area.
    * The **Image Preview** box in the GUI will show the selected image if the path is valid.
    * Click **Save Spell**.
4.  **Repeat Step 3** for all the spells you want the helper to recognize and use. Your added spells will appear in the "Configured Spells" list.
5.  **Adjust Settings (Optional):** ‚öôÔ∏è
    * Go to the **Detection Settings** tab.
    * **Match Threshold:** Controls how closely the image must match (0.1 to 1.0). Higher values are stricter. Start around `0.7` or `0.8` and adjust if needed.
    * **Min Spell Duration:** How long (in seconds) the helper might keep pressing the keybind if the same spell icon remains detected.
    * **Toggle Hotkey:** Change the key combination used to start/stop detection globally.
    * Click **Save Settings** after making changes.
6.  **Save Configuration:** üíæ
    * Go back to the **Spells** tab.
